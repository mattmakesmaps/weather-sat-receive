# Recieve Weather Satellite Images

This site is a collection of notes on recieving weather satellite images using amateur radio hardware and software.

My notes can be found here:

- [NOAA APT](noaa-apt.md)
- [NOAA GOES](noaa-goes.md)

Here is a curated list of links I've found to be helpful

73 - KI7ZTH

### Software Packages

- [SDR# aka SDRSharp](https://airspy.com/download/): Software used to demodulate signals recieved
    from an SDR.
- [GOESTools](https://pietern.github.io/goestools/index.html)
- [WX2IMG]():
    A commonly used windows tool to convert intercepted APT signals into images.
    Note that this project is abandoned. I'm linking to a local copy which I've
    verified works on Windows 10.
- [OpenSatelliteProject](https://github.com/opensatelliteproject/OpenSatelliteProject):
    Don't really know what this project does yet.

- [GOES Satellite Hunt (Part 1 â€“ Antenna System)](https://www.teske.net.br/lucas/2016/10/goes-satellite-hunt-part-1-antenna-system/): October 2016.
    This is the first of a five part series by [@lucasteske](https://twitter.com/lucasteske) on the 
    development of hardware/software required to pull down NOAA GOES information. The software is
    encapsulated in the [OpenSatelliteProject](https://github.com/opensatelliteproject).
- [SARCNET - Mini Satellite-Antenna Rotator Mk1](https://www.sarcnet.org/projects/project_rotator.html):
Original 2016, updated with new build information. Detailed plans on designing an arduino-powered satellite
tracking roatator for the Arrow antenna. See their homepage for a comprehensive list of other projects.
